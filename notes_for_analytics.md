# Ideas
Cool stuff to show the user with their data:
- What time of the day are you most active on tiktok?
- What the most times you have shared/watched a video and what was it?
- Relation between liked -> shared -> favorite?
- Followed Creators: Examine the TikTok creators the user follows and highlight any notable trends or commonalities among the creators they follow.
- Demographics of Creators: Analyze the demographics of the creators the user engages with. Are there patterns in terms of age, location, or content themes?
- Privacy and Data Analysis: If the user allows, you can also discuss what data TikTok collects about their viewing habits and how it's used to personalize content recommendations.
- Viewing Habits Over Time: Examine how the user's viewing habits have evolved throughout the year. Have there been shifts in the types of content they engage with or in their overall activity?
- Content Genres: Categorize the content genres the user frequently engages with. Are they more interested in humor, educational content, DIY, cooking, or any other specific category?
- Frequency of Usage: Investigate how often the user accesses the TikTok app. Is it a daily habit, or do they use it more sporadically?
- Content Preferences: Discuss the user's content preferences, such as their favorite creators, recurring themes in the content they engage with, and any standout videos they've liked or favored.
- Engagement Peaks: Identify if there were specific moments or events during the year when the user's TikTok engagement was particularly high.
- How many videos from history are ads?
- most popular hashtag (from all dataset, month, week, day)?
- relation between watched content and trends
